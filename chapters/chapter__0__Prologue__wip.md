## Prologue

By a dimly lit campfire in a dark forest, a middle aged man pulled his fur cloak to better keep in the warmth. Bitter could hardly describe this environment. The land was wet, the wind cold, and one could not see well for this impenetrable fog was ever present. The man could hear the caws of a crow in the distance and the bushes rustling with the wind.

The man appeared relaxed and even laid back, yet his black eyes would endlessly dart from shadow to shadow that danced with each flicker of the fire. He narrowed his eyes and reaffirmed his thoughts 'This forest couldn't be trusted.'.
