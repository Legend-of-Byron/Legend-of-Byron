## Prologue

"Caw caw"

Byron slowly opened his eyes to find himself in a familiar dark dream like world. He stood at the shore infront of the entrance to a gloomy forest. The strong wind ceasely blowing and the rain pounding the earth. The sound of thunder occasionally going off in the distance.

'This place again..?' he frowned while taking in the suroundings.

Since the announce of the major release of a new deep dive MMORPG called Path of God, he had been lucky enough to have been selected for the ALPHA program. The company responsible for the creation of this game had sent him a special human sized pod.

The pod connects the player's mind to the network, allowing access to the game in a dream state. The company announced that this method allowed player's to enjoy a 1:2 game time ratio. One hour in the real world would be two hours in the game world.

The world went in an uproar when the announcement was made.
