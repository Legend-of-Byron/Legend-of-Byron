## Prologue

"Caw caw"

Byron slowly opened his eyes to find himeself in a familiar dark dream like world, at the shore infront of the entrance to a gloomy forest. The strong wind ceasely blowing and the rain pounding the earth. The sound of thunder occasionally going off in the distance.

'This place agin..?' he frowned while taking in the suroundings.

He called it the blackforest simply because it had an air of gloomyness. A place any normal
person would avoid without a second thought.
